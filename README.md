# what about?

It is a private hub of my GitJournal which collect all records from various equipment(Github endpoints,Obsidian app on linux,GitJournal app on android)

# what in this repo?

They are only daily todo list or trivals notes with little privacy.In the future I might keep records of some daily thoughts which is worth being shared or spread. 

# why this? 

I just want to write down my notes of thoughts  wherever I want， so I sync data among different platform with GH repo. Now I can read or write wherever I want.

# how to？

1.set up Obsidian on computer, then install an adds-on of git which enable git action (you can set it to auto pull and push in a desired patterns) 
2.Use GitJournal on Phone and set specified config for synchroning with Github page.
3.In both GitJournal and Obsidian, you have to register the public keys for synchroning with Github.
