# What it is?

It is a private hub of my GitJournal which collect all records from various equipment(Github endpoints,Obsidian app on linux,GitJournal app on android)

#What are the contents or records?
They are only daily todo list or trivals notes with little privacy.In the future I might keep records of some daily thoughts which is worth being shared or spread. 

# why do this instead of bloging? 

I just want to write down my notes of thoughts  wherever I want， so I sync data among different platform with GH repo. Now I can read or write wherever I want.

# how to sysnc notes？

1.set up Obsidian on computer, then install an adds-on of git which enable git action (you can set it to auto pull and push in a desired patterns) 
2.Use GitJournal on Phone and set specified config for synchroning with Github page.
